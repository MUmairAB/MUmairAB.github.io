<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a dedicated researcher and practitioner at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Machine Learning, with a strong emphasis on their applications in domains such as Education, Social Good, Law, Healthcare, Human-AI Interaction,	AI Interpretability, Social Media Analysis, and Embodied AI. With over six years of diverse experience spanning both academia and industry, I have developed expertise in designing scalable AI systems, conducting applied and theoretical research, and contributing to impactful open-source projects that push the boundaries of AI innovation.

As an active member of the Python open-source community and a passionate writer on technical and societal topics, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world impact. My goal is to combine practical engineering expertise with rigorous research to address meaningful challenges in AI.
